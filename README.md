# Introduction to Ollama Online

Ollama is an AI-powered chatbot framework that allows developers to integrate conversational AI into their applications. It uses machine learning models to generate human-like responses to user queries. The key feature of Ollama is its ability to work with various machine learning models and offer a customizable environment for developers to build their chatbot applications.

To make Ollama accessible online, you need to set up the Ollama API and ensure it's publicly available for external requests. Typically, the Ollama API is hosted on a local server, but to allow users to interact with it from anywhere, you need to make it available over the internet.

## Steps to Make Ollama Online on Hostinger

If you're hosting your project on Hostinger, the procedure to make Ollama accessible online will include configuring your server and deploying the necessary infrastructure. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve that:

*Step 1: Set Up a Hostinger VPS or Shared Hosting Account*

*1.Create a Hostinger Account:* If you don’t have a Hostinger account, sign up at Hostinger.

*2.Choose a Plan:* Hostinger offers both VPS (Virtual Private Server) and Shared Hosting plans. For Ollama, a VPS plan will be most suitable because it gives you full control over the environment, allowing you to install and run Ollama without restrictions.

*3.Access Your Hosting Account:* Log in to your Hostinger dashboard to manage your hosting services.

*Step 2: Set Up Your VPS*
*1.Provision a VPS:*

* In your Hostinger dashboard, navigate to the VPS section and create a new VPS.
* Select the specifications (CPU, RAM, storage) based on your needs. Ollama doesn't require a lot of resources, but having a VPS with at least 1 GB of RAM is recommended for smoother performance.

 *2. Access Your VPS:*

* Once your VPS is provisioned, you will get access credentials, including the IP address, username (usually root), and password.
* Use SSH to access your VPS from your terminal:
ssh root@your-vps-ip

*3. Install Necessary Software:*

* Ensure your VPS has the required software to run Ollama (like Docker, PHP, or a web server such as Apache or Nginx).
* For Ollama, you’ll typically need Docker to run the AI model services.

* Step 5: Set Up Your PHP Backend (If Required)*
*1.Install PHP:* If your backend needs to communicate with the Ollama API, you can install PHP on your VPS:
sudo apt install php php-cli php-curl

*2.Update PHP Code to Communicate with Ollama:* Modify your PHP backend to send requests to the Ollama API on the VPS (replace http://127.0.0.1:11434 with the VPS IP address or domain):
$url = "http://your-vps-ip:11434/api/chat";  // Update with your VPS IP or domain

*3.Test Communication:* Ensure that the backend can send requests and receive responses from Ollama. Use cURL or file_get_contents in PHP to send messages and receive replies.
